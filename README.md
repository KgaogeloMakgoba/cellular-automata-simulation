### Project Description

This project is a C++ implementation of the Rule 30 elementary cellular automaton.

It simulates the evolution of a one-dimensional array of cells where each cell can be either alive or dead, and its next state is determined by its current state and the state of its immediate neighbors.



The simulation demonstrates how simple local rules can produce complex and unpredictable patterns, a concept widely used in computer science, physics, and theoretical biology.





### Program Features

-Menu-driven interface

-Array size provided via command-line argument

-User-defined number of evolution rounds

-Option to:

&nbsp; -Randomly initialize the automaton

&nbsp; -Manually set initial cell values

-Visual output showing the evolution of the automaton over multiple rounds

-Wrap-around behavior for edge cells

-Clean separation of logic using the CellularSpace namespace

-Uses dynamic memory allocation





### How to Run

-Compile the program

-Run with array size as a command-line argument(one argument only)

-Follow the on-screen menu to configure and run the simulation.
